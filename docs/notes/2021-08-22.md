## Inventory Management
When we equip an item it now remembers it.  Currently, we just store a string of the item name to show that a character has something equipped.  We may have to do something different later, if we want items that have special stats, but for now this should work.

We also calculate the defense by checking all of our equipped items and adding the defense to our base defense.  This doesn't do anything during combat yet.

# Notes for 2021-08-17

## Battle Scene
Instead of just having the first character battle we now swap between characters to give them each a turn.

When we pick up our new character from the main map, we didn't include the strength, dex and int stats.

Prepared the battle scene to pull up the current character info, so we can use this to determine damage values during battle.

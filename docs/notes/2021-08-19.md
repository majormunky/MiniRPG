# Notes for 2021-08-19

## World Loading Fix
When we went into town, and then back out to the world, the battle would break.  When we would switch maps, we would try to reload some data that should only be loaded once when the game starts.  The battle scene now works after going to town.


## Fixed Bug - Opening multiple chests at once
If we sit between 2 chests and inspect, we can open both chests at once.  This results in just one dialog with one of the items.   We now check our global GameData.dialog_open flag to see if we have a dialog opened or not, before trying to open a chest.  We now open chests one at a time.
